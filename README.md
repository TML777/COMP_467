An extra credit assignment building a scraper to display 3 facts about a given content/show/movie.


## Project 1
This script facilitates the parsing, computation, and export of data between Baselight and Xytech work orders, transitioning file storage from local Baselight systems to facility storage. It handles errors in third-party data and ensures accurate processing of frame ranges and locations.

## Project 2
Automation script in Python, that populates a database with global QA reports. Python code duplicates the workflow of Global App Testing Company and updates a QA database. Instantly create reports for operations, including listing all blockers, repeatable, date, and/or specific users.

## Project 3
Automation script in Python that automates 4 manual positions in seconds. Python code reads proprietary data from Baselight machines to calculate the filesystem locations of frames. All requests are saved to a database and can be used for data analysis and worker efficiency. Exports are basic CSV files to XLS files with timecode and thumbnail preview uploaded to Frame.IO

## Weekly Assignments
