If the AI runs out of cards and doesn't have any cards to draw, the AI opponent is stuck in the drawing phase and rather than switching turns,the AI just stays and waits the entire turn. The player must wait until the opponents turn is over, and is either stuck doing nothing or attacks the enemy only to switch turns and wait until the enemy's timer to finish to switch to their turn.",I was expecting to get more cards in the tutorial instead of a limited amount rather than having to wait for the opponents clock to finish because they also can't draw any cards,I had to wait the entire opponents turn to make a move cause they didn't want to skip,Yes,No,Omar Garcia
